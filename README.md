Sure! Here's a clean and professional README.md file for a face detection project using OpenCV, with your author name included:
# Face Detection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). It uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces from a live webcam feed or static images.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using webcam
- Face detection on static images
- Highlight detected faces with bounding boxes
- Lightweight and easy to run

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)

You can install OpenCV using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
